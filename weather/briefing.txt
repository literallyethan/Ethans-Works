Mission Briefing: Weather Station Data Logger
Background:

In the age of climate change and environmental awareness, tracking and analyzing weather patterns is more important than ever. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves developing a Weather Station Data Logger using Ada. This system will not only log various weather parameters but also provide analytics and insights into local weather patterns.
Core Objectives:

    Sensor Integration: Interface with weather sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. If actual hardware is not available, simulate sensor input with randomly generated data.
    Data Logging: Store the collected data with timestamps, allowing for historical weather data analysis.
    Alert System: Implement a threshold-based alert system for extreme weather conditions, such as high wind speeds or sudden drops in temperature, notifying the user via console messages or emails.

Advanced Objectives:

    Data Analysis: Provide statistical analysis of the weather data, such as average, median, and trends over specified periods. Highlight significant changes or anomalies in the data.
    Graphical Representation: Generate graphs or charts to visualize the weather data trends over time. This could involve interfacing with a graphical library or generating data for external graphing tools.
    Web Interface: Develop a simple web interface where users can view the current weather conditions, historical data, and alerts. This could be a basic web server running locally on the user’s machine.

Deployment Phases:
Phase 1: Research and Design

    Determine the types of weather data to be collected.
    Design the data structures and database schema for storing the weather data.
    Plan the architecture of the system, including the sensor simulation, data logging mechanism, and alert system.

Phase 2: Core Development

    Implement the sensor data collection or simulation, focusing on modularity to easily switch between simulated and real sensor data in the future.
    Develop the data logging system, ensuring efficient and organized storage of the weather data.
    Create the alert system, defining customizable thresholds for different weather parameters.

Phase 3: Analysis and Visualization

    Build the analysis tools to process and summarize the weather data.
    Implement basic graphical representation capabilities, even if it’s just generating data for external tools.

Phase 4: Expansion and Refinement

    If feasible, add a simple web interface to access real-time and historical weather data.
    Refine the user interface and experience based on feedback or user testing.
    Implement additional features, such as exporting data reports or integrating with online weather services for predictive comparisons.
