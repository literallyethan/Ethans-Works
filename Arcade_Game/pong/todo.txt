maybe add structs on the borders to bounce off of?
   //nah thats stupid

TODO:
x   1. implement wall bouncing
    x   i.   struct elements up/down speed and horizontal speed
    x   ii.  when you hit a wall, set respective speed to
             SPEED = -SPEED
    x   iii. when it adds, its subtracting if its negative
    x   iv.  so, project an imaginary ball where the ball WILL go and bounce
             if necessary
x   2. make paddles
    3. make paddles movable
        i. using differing inputs for 2 players
    4. implement paddle bouncing
    5. implement detection for hitting goal zones
    6. implement score
        i. super cool to have displayable structs
           that are big numbers that change with score
